#In this tutorial we will cover while statements
#When using while statements code is executed while certain conditions are true

i = 0
num = 5


while i < num do
 puts("Inside the loop i = #{i}")
   i +=1
 end  

#The code above will run as long as i is less than 5 a
#The output will be as below

Inside the loop i = 0
Inside the loop i = 1
Inside the loop i = 2
Inside the loop i = 3
Inside the loop i = 4
